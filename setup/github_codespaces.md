# Github codespaces
A [codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud.

# Creating your codespace
* [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the [Web Bootcamp 2024](https://github.com/iris-nitk-pvt/web-bootcamp-2024) repo (if you haven't already)
* Click on **Code** and from the codespaces dropdown click on the âž• icon to create a new codespace.

* You can install the [GitHub codespaces extenction](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces)
for VScode, if don't like to work in browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Github codespaces will have `rvm`, `node` and `yarn` preinstalled so you can get started off working with rails.
