    A private repository named `ror-bootcamp-2024-<your-github-username>` will be created under the organization `iris-nitk-pvt`. Only you and the admins will have access to this repository.

8. Now, you can **clone the repository** as usual.

## How to Submit Each Week's Assignment

1. Change your directory to the repository you cloned:
    ```bash
    cd ror-bootcamp-2024-<your-github-username>
    ```

2. Each week's task will be located in a folder named `week_<n>`, where `n` is the week number (e.g., the task for Week 1 will be in the folder `week_1`).

3. Navigate to the week's directory using the following command:
    ```bash
    cd week_<n>
    ```

4. Inside the `week_<n>` folder, **create a folder** called `submission`:
    ```bash
    mkdir submission
    ```

5. In the `submission` folder, add all the required files for the assignment. Additionally, create a **README file** named `week-<n>-submission.md` (e.g., `week-1-submission.md` for Week 1). In this file, include:
    - Screenshots (if required)
    - Details about your submission

6. You may add any additional files or folders necessary to complete the assignment within the `submission` folder.
7. Once you have completed the assignment, you can push the changes to the repository by following these steps:

   - **Add the required files**: 
 
     *(The command below adds all files in the current directory. However, it is recommended to add only the files you have specifically changed. You may also use the GUI of Visual Studio Code to select and add files.)*
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - **Commit the changes**:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Completed week <n> assignment"
     ```
   - **Push the changes** to the repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

    Only the mentors have access to view all the repositories created for this bootcamp, and we will evaluate them accordingly. Therefore, there is no need to create a Pull Request.
