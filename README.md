# IRIS Ruby on Rails Bootcamp 2024
IRIS Ruby on Rails Bootcamp will be a month-long training program for the students to learn programming skills through a hands-on experience, mentored by developers from IRIS Web team.
 
You will be shared detailed tutorials where we teach development the IRIS way, with weekly assignments to apply your learning.

## [Essential Git](/essential_git.md)

## [Installation Guide](/setup)
We have provided three ways of setting up a development environment,
[Local Setup](/setup/local_setup.md), [GitHub codespaces](/setup/github_codespaces.md)
and [Dev Container](/setup/dev_container.md). We recommend you to choose [GitHub codespaces](/setup/github_codespaces.md)
if you face any issues while installing ruby [locally](/setup/local_setup.md).

## [Week 1 - The Basics](/week_1)
In the first week, we will introduce you to basic concepts related to Web Development, Ruby and Git.
