# Week 2: Introduction to Models in Ruby on Rails (RoR)

In Week 2, you will start learning Ruby on Rails by writing code. This week, youâ€™ll create a basic Rails project and begin building a simple **form management system** similar to Google Forms or IRIS Forms. The project you create this week will be extended in future assignments. This week we will focus on building the **models** for this project.

# Assignment

You will work on a single Ruby on Rails project from this week onwards. This project will serve as the foundation for future assignments, so ensure that it is set up correctly.

### Project Idea:
Imagine building a form creation tool similar to Google Forms or IRIS Forms. The project will allow users to create, manage, and submit forms.

### Steps for this Week:

1. **Create a New Ruby on Rails Project** - *30 points*   - [Follow this](./create_ror_project.md)
   - Set up a new Ruby on Rails project from scratch.

2. **Create Models in the Rails Project** - *70 points*  - [Follow this](./create_models.md)
   - Implement the models that map to the database schema of forms application. These models should include relationships between different parts of your form system, such as questions, responses, and forms.
  
3. **BONUS Task - Generate the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the Database** - *30 points*
   - Use a Rails gem to automatically generate the ERD for the database schema you have created.

## Submission Guidelines

- A Rails project should be created in the root directory of your GitHub repository (i.e `ror-bootcamp-2024-<your_github_username>`).
- All the code written during this week should be within this Rails project.
- Create a README file named `week-2-submission.md` inside the `week_2` folder, explaining the steps you followed to complete each task, along with relevant screenshots where necessary.
