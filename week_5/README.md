# Week 5: Associations and Validations

We have learned a lot so far! Starting from Ruby basics to models, controllers, and views, we've come a long way. Yet,
many essential concepts remain to be covered, with two of the most important being **Associations** and **Validations**.

# Assignment

This week, you will continue working on the same Ruby on Rails project from last week. You will extend the project by
adding associations and validations to it.

### Steps for This Week

* **Realize the associations already present in the project** - [Steps](./associations.md)
* **Create a system to invite users to view or edit a form** - [Steps](./invite_users.md)
    * A form owner can invite other users to view or edit the form.
        * A `viewer` can only view the form and its responses.
        * An `editor` can view form responses and edit the Form.
* **Add Validations for form fields** - [Steps](./validations.md)
    * Add validations to the form fields to ensure that the user enters the correct data.
* BONUSâ€”**Add a deadline to the form**
    * A form owner can set a deadline for the form. After the deadline, the form will not accept any responses.
